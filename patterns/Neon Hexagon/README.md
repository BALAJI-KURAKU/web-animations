# 🌌 Neon Hexagon — Glowing Geometry in Motion

Imagine a neon city skyline… but instead of buildings, the lights themselves wander, twist, and form an endless hexagonal dance.  
**Neon Hexagon** is a pure HTML5 canvas experiment where glowing lines explore space, branch at 60° angles, and occasionally sparkle like they’re showing off.

## ✨ What is Neon Hexagon?
A living, glowing network of lines:
- Spawns at the center and grows in hexagonal directions
- Glows and fades with smooth color transitions
- Sprinkles sparks for extra visual magic
- Runs infinitely — a tiny universe that never repeats exactly

## 🎛 Customize the Chaos

Want faster lines? Different colors? More sparks?

Tweak the opts object in script.js:

```bash
var opts = {
  len: 20,          // Length of each segment
  count: 50,        // How many lines exist at once
  hueChange: 0.1,   // Speed of color cycling
  sparkChance: 0.1, // Probability of extra spark
  baseLight: 50,    // Glow brightness
  // ... more settings inside
};


Experiment and make your own visual style.
